This BATCH shell script is inherently insecure. Take a look at the first
few lines:

    SET INPUT=
    SET /P INPUT=Insert password:
    IF "%INPUT%"=="" "%~0"

What if our "INPUT" was "=="" ? Then the line would read:

    IF ""=="" "=="" "%~0"

Confusing right? Well ""=="" is true, so lets tack on some extra stuff:\
Lets try "=="" GOTO :END (Don't forget the extra space at the end of
END)

    IF ""=="" GOTO :END "=="" "%~0"

That part is cool! We get sent straigt to the end!:

    Insert password:"=="" GOTO :END
    The password value is 1
    Access denied!

But we still are not getting through, well let us set the password to
the number they are expecting then goto the end!

    "=="" SET PASSWORDVALUE=1065435274 && GOTO :END 

    Insert password:"=="" SET PASSWORDVALUE=1065435274 && GOTO :END 
    You have been authenticated. Welcome aboard!

Yay!

A Factors Program
-----------------

I forgot what this does:

    #!/bin/bash
    for EACH in `seq 1000 2000`
    do 

    NUMBER=`echo "(2 ^ 32 ) * $EACH + 1065435274" | bc`
    FACTORS=`factor $NUMBER | cut -f 2 -d : `
    NOF=`echo $FACTORS | tr " " "\n" | wc -l`
    #echo "The number of FACTORS in $NUMBER is $NOF, WHICH ARE $FACTORS"
    BAD=0
    for EACH2 in `seq 1 $NOF`
    do
        FACTOR=`echo $FACTORS | cut -f $EACH2 -d " "`
    #   echo -n "$FACTOR "
        if [ $FACTOR -gt 101 ]; then
        BAD=1
        fi
    done
    if [ $BAD -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "The number of FACTORS in $NUMBER is $NOF, WHICH ARE $FACTORS"
    fi

    done
