This mission is stupid. Start with the file, untar it:

    $ tar xzvf stego14.tar.gz 
    6578747261637400.jpg

If you look really carefully at that "jpg" under a hex editor you may
notice that is is also a rar.

    $ cp 6578747261637400.jpg file.rar
    $ unrar e file.rar
    Extracting  key.jpg                                                   OK 
    All OK

So you have 2 things now, the Cipher text of PGNNZCFYXD (yes that is a D
at the end, not 0) and a key of (\*5+10). If you are clairvoyant you
might notice that this is an affine cipher. Input this in a decoder:

You will get "bulldozinj" (not bulldozing, that is a red herring)
