This given bitmap has a single row of grey values, with the hint 'I am
the not of a file'. This sounds like the values are the "not" as in,
inverse of a file. This python script I wrote will spit out the values
of the bitmap:

    #!/usr//bin/python
    import Image
    import sys
    im = Image.open("12.bmp")
    newnumber = 0
    oldnumber = 0
    counter = 0
    width = range(0,123)
    hight = range(0,1)
    for each2 in hight:
            for each1 in width:
                    it = im.getpixel((each1,each2))
                    print chr(255-it),
                    sys.stdout.softspace = 0
    print 

If you run this you get:

    PK���t��8ZJ�G       pass.txt6ae4nt5TBPK����t��8ZJ�G     � pass.txtPK���6/

There is something in there... is that a zip file?

    $ python decode.py > file
    $ file file
    file: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
    $ unzip file
    Archive:  file
     extracting: pass.txt  
    $ cat pass.txt
