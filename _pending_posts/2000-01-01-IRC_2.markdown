This may or may not work, depending on your operating system, browser,
and IRC client.

This exploits a flaw in older versions of mIRC where a buffer overflow
in a DCC SEND command will cause the client (and therefore the bot
script) to crash. "/raw" tells your client to send this raw string
instead of formatting it as you saying something, etc. "PRIVMSG moo"
tells the server that you are private messaging moo " :�" The space,
colon, and 0001 unicode character are required by the IRC protocol "DCC
SEND "..."" tells the remote client that you are trying to direct
connect to send file "..." "1370673706 3500 4" related to the IRC
protocol
