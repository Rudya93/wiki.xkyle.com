This challenge has a stereo audio file with the left and right out of phase. Mixing them together produces the difference, which contains morse code.

<pre>
$ sox ecstasy-atb-music.wav  -c 1 out.wav
</pre>

If you can decode morse by ear you go it! Otherwise use rscw or do it by hand:
<pre>
sox out.wav  -t ub - | rscw  -f 720-750 -w 11
</pre>

This will give you a string of numbers that represent ascii characters. Use a decimal to ascii converter
