= TL:DR =
 ipmicfg  -nm oemgetpower
 #or 
 ipmi-oem intelnm get-node-manager-statistics
 #or
 ipmi-dcmi --get-system-power-statistics
 #or
 ipmitool -H ipmihost -U root -P root delloem powermonitor
One of those will probably work?

= Intel =
Requirements:
* ME enabled BIOS
* PMBus 1.1/1.2 spec compliant power supply
* IPMI firmware with Node Manager support
Commands:
 ipmi-oem intelnm get-node-manager-statistics

= Dell =
Dell [[DRAC]] has its own thing, but you can also use ipmi:
 ipmi-oem intelnm get-node-manager-statistics

For some reason on my Dell this does not work:
 ipmi-oem dell get-power-consumption-data
or 
 ipmitool -H ipmihost -U root -P root delloem powermonitor

This also works for some reason:
 ipmi-dcmi --get-system-power-statistics

I guess because it is dell and intel?
