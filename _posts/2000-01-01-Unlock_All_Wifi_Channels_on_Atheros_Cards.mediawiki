These are instructions on how to unlock a Atheros (madwifi) card to untold frequencies!

First get your frequencies that you have now:
<pre>
iwlist ath0 freq
</pre>

Now change your regulatory domain and then modprobe with a new country code. I had to do -g 1:0 to enable writing to my eeprom, you may have to use a different GPIO other than 1. Also your memory base will probably not be on fbef000 unless you have the same eeepc that I have.

<pre>
ifconig ath0 down
rmmod ath_pci
ath_info -g 1:0 -w fbef0000 regdomain 0x00
modprobe ath_pci countrycode=511
</pre>

Now check your freqencies:
<pre>
iwlist ath0 freq
</pre>

Enjoy you new channels.... :)

P.S. One problem with this is the limited power on these wide channels. If you need power you should choose a country code that has a good power level for the frequency you need. Check out
