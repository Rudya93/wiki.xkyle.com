=== Serial Port ===
To do any real hacking on the Dockstar, you have to connect the serial console to your computer. I recommend using [https://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8772 sparkfun's 3.3v FTDI board] to make it easy. Then connect up the matching pins according to the diagram:
