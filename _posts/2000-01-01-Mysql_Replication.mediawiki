Quick start setting up mysql replication:

=== Master Setup ===
First setup a replication mysql user that will do this for you (run this on the master):
 GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'replicant'@'slave_host' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_pwd';

Now on the master, setup a server id and a bin log in my.cnf:
 server-id = 1
 log-bin = /var/log/mysql/bin.log

=== Slave Setup ===
Setup an id and log file for my.cnf:
<pre>
server-id = 2

master-host = Master IP
master-port = 3306
master-user = replicant
master-password = my_pwd

log-bin = /var/log/mysql/bin.log
log-bin-index = /var/log/mysql/log-bin.index
log-error = /var/log/mysql/error.log

relay-log = /var/log/mysql/relay.log
relay-log-info-file = /var/log/mysql/relay-log.info
relay-log-index = /var/log/mysql/relay-log.index
</pre>

=== Sync An Initial snapshot of your data ===
This can be done with mysqldump, mysqlhotcopy, or just scp. Make sure the tables are locked or mysql is shut down.

=== Start the Slave ===
Start it up with the new data, then "START SLAVE;" or "mysqladmin start-slave" on the slave.

=== Making Backups === 
To make backups on the slave server, simply stop the slave, make the backup, then start it again
 mysqladmin stop-slave
 mysqldump -A > dump.sql
 mysqladmin start-slave
