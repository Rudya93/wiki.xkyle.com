This program take the letters you type in, assigns a prime value to it, and multiplies them all together. The catch is that that number is mod 2 ^32. So we need to find out what the original composite number is, then factor it. Here is a bash script to do it:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
for EACH in `seq 1 2000`
do

NUMBER=`echo "(2 ^ 32 ) * $EACH + 1065435274" | bc`
FACTORS=`factor $NUMBER | cut -f 2 -d : `
NOF=`echo $FACTORS | tr " " "\n" | wc -l`
#echo "The number of FACTORS in $NUMBER is $NOF, WHICH ARE $FACTORS"
BAD=0
for EACH2 in `seq 1 $NOF`
do
        FACTOR=`echo $FACTORS | cut -f $EACH2 -d " "`
#       echo -n "$FACTOR "
        if [ $FACTOR -gt 101 ]; then
        BAD=1
        fi
done
if [ $BAD -eq 0 ]; then
echo "The number of FACTORS in $NUMBER is $NOF, WHICH ARE $FACTORS"
fi

done
</pre>

We only want those composite numbers who have factors less than 101, that way it produces valid letters.

<pre>
root@server:~/hts/extbasic# bash 10.sh
The number of FACTORS in 4588090507402 is 9, WHICH ARE  2 17 19 23 37 41 47 61 71
</pre>

Those letters are an anagram for "logarithm" and "algorithm"
