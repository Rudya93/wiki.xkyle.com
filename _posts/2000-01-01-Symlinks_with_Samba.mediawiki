Samba by default will not allow symlinks to go outside of a share for [http://www.samba.org/samba/news/symlink_attack.html security reasons.]

But sometimes you need to do this anyway.

First add this to your global conf to stop people from making bogus symlinks: [http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#UNIXEXTENSIONS ref]
 [global]
    unix extensions = no

Then add this to a share to allow symlinks to go to places outside the share: [http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#WIDELINKS ref]
 [share]
    #Allows symlinks to traverse outside the share
    wide links = yes
