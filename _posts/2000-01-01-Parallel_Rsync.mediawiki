Sorry, there isn't such a thing (that I know of?)

But you can emulate it with the [[Parallel]] utility.

 parallel -i -j 24 /usr/bin/rsync -aPv "{}" root@remote-server:/Destination/ -- /Source/*

Assuming your source can be globbed into good buckets. Adjust -j as needed. This assumes that your IO is '''not''' the bottleneck.
