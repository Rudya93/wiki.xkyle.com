 yum install OpenIPMI ipmitool

 Service ipmi start  
(provides /dev/ipmi0; OpenIPMI has its own set of tools, but ipmitool works with it, and I like it.)

 ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr 160.91.33.41
 ipmitool lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0
 ipmitool lan set 1 defgw 160.91.33.1
 ipmitool lan set 1 defgw ipaddr 160.91.33.1

 ipmitool user set password 2 foo  (default user name of this account is ADMIN)

 vi /etc/init/serial-ttyS2.conf   
(Silicon Mechanics seems to enable this by default.  This can be disabled or edited in the bios to other com ports).
