The [[Intel One Boot Flash Update Utility]] is an Intel tool to flash firmwares of Intel systems. It has EFI/Linux/Windows implementations.

The Linux implementation is called '''flashupdt'''. It takes a config argument that expects a kind of config file.

Making this command run non-interactivly is not obvious. Here is an example of using this command on a S2600GZ:
<pre>
CONFIGURATION "XXX" "S2600GL:S2600GZ,2.0"
FWDNAME     "BMC_i_0116r4010.bin"  filetype=fwimg
BIOSNAME    "R01.06.0001.cap"
IMENAME     "MEComplete_02.01.05.107.cap"
FRUNAME     "S2600GZ.fru"
FRUADDRESS  0
FRUAREA     "BOARD"
FRUAREA     "HEADER"
FRUAREA     "INTERNALUSE"
FRUAREA     "CHASSIS"
FRUFIELD    "CT"
FRUAREA     "BOARD"
FRUFIELD    "MN"
FRUFIELD    "PN"
FRUFIELD    "ID"
FRUFIELD    "MN"
SDRNAME     "S2600GZ.sdr"         // Update SDR Repository
BMC_REFRESH // Run the init agent to force the BMC to use the newly flashed in SDR data
</pre>

By analyzing the provided MASTER.cfg, you can deduce what lines need to exist in an unattended version. This is just an example.
