The clock I'm building is a massive [[led]] powered clock based off of [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=47&page=6|these schematics] and a <strike>[[pic]] microcontroller.</strike> [[Arduino]].

== Router Interface ==
The clock interfaces with a [[Wrt54gl]] for time updates, twitter commands, and vpn connectivity. 
* [[get-twitter]] reads the @replies for relevantclock for commands, parses them, and sends them to...
* [[clockctl]] reads in commands and interfaces with the serial port.
* [[send-twitter]] can send out updates.


== Software ==
The original firmware: [[Image:SFE-WallClock-v01.zip]]
