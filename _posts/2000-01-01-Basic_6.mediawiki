In this mission you are given a kindergarten-encrypted password, and you need to reverse-engineer the encryption.
<br>You'll notice that if you encrypt "aaaaa" it gives you "abcde". This encryption simply adds the character number to the character, starting at 0.
<br>You can use http://www.asciitable.com/ to find the progression of symbols.
Ex. if your encrypted password is "968d<56>" you need to subtract 1 from the second letter, 2 from the third, and three from the fourth, producing "956a". It isn't obvious what < goes to, so use the link to find out that it is "8". Continuing, you end up with "956a8007", which correctly "encrypts" to "968d<56>".

A little tool made by mys3c0ndw0rld to decrypt the password :
