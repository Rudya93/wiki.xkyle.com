[[FlexLM]] uses the lmgrd program to host license servers. It comes with the crappiest init script you can imagine. Here is an [[Upstart]] script in its place. Specifically it is for an intel license manager, but should be edited to meet your particular license manager needs:

<pre>
# flexlm for intel compiler

start on stopped rc RUNLEVEL=3

stop on starting rc RUNLEVEL=[!3]

console output
respawn
respawn limit 3 120
expect fork
exec /opt/intel/flexlm/lmgrd.intel -c /opt/intel/flexlm/server.lic -l /opt/intel/flexlm/lmgrd.intel.log
</pre>

Stick that in file called /etc/init/lmgrd-intel.conf or the like. Start it like any other [[Upstart]] job.
