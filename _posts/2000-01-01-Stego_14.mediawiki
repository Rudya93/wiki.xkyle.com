This mission is stupid. Start with the file, untar it:

<pre>
$ tar xzvf stego14.tar.gz 
6578747261637400.jpg
</pre>

If you look really carefully at that "jpg" under a hex editor you may notice that is is also a rar.

<pre>
$ cp 6578747261637400.jpg file.rar
$ unrar e file.rar
Extracting  key.jpg                                                   OK 
All OK
</pre>

So you have 2 things now, the Cipher text of PGNNZCFYXD (yes that is a D at the end, not 0) and a key of (*5+10). If you are clairvoyant you might notice that this is an affine cipher. Input this in a decoder:

You will get "bulldozinj" (not bulldozing, that is a red herring)
