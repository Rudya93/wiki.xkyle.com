[[Google Authenticator]] is a time based one time password thing that runs on smartphones. It is open source, and is included in modern ubuntu repositories.

=== Install App ===
Find it in the market/appstore/etc

=== Install Pam Module ===
 apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
or compile it:
 hg clone https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/

=== Configure Pam ===
Stick this line at the top of any pam config to use the module:
 auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

Other ways:
<pre>
# If the user is NOT in group "otp_users", skip next module
auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so user notingroup otp_users
auth       required     pam_google_authenticator.so secret=/var/run/user/${USER}/.google_authenticator
auth       include      password-auth
</pre>

=== Configure User ===
As the user run:
 google-authenticator

It will setup a .google_authenticator file, and give you a QR code to scan for the app. Alternatively you can type in the secret manually.

=== Issues ===
If you use public key authentication, it bypasses PAM, and never gets to the google authenticator pam module. [http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/issues/detail?id=40 Google Issue 40] [http://blog.endpoint.com/2011/03/google-2-factor-authentication.html Another Guy Who Confirms this]
