You need to have outputting to serial:
=== Bios ===
Usually this is described as Console Redirection. The bios might give you an option between serial ports, one is usually the IPMI and the other is the physical one.

Sometimes you can have it redirect "Legacy" or "Bootloader" output too. That would be nice if you want to skip the next one.
=== Bootloader ===
* Grub: [[Serial Output on GRUB]]
* pxelinux: [[PXE Options]]
 SERIAL 0 115200

=== Linux Console ===
Linux command line in your boot loader:
 console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8
=== Linux Getty ===
