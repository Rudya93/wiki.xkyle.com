When a name is entered, the system creates a file in
/basic/8/tmp/randomjunk.shtml with some irrelevant information in it.\
If you google for ".shtml" you'll see that that is an extension for
Server Side Include executables. Googleing for "ssi exec" you'll find
that <pre<!--#exec cmd="command" -->

</pre>
will return the output from running "command". We know that this is a
linux/unix server from the directory style, starting with "/" instead of
"C:\\", so we'll use the "ls" command to list the contents of the
directory. Put this in as your name:

    <!--#exec cmd="ls" -->

and then go to the created file. You should see a list of randomly named
files in the name area. Using the combination of this and directory
transversals (google it - "." is the current directory, ".." is one
directory up) we can go from webroot/missions/basic/8/tmp/ to
webroot/missions/basic/8/ without having to specify the full path.

    <!--#exec cmd="ls .." -->

will show you the obscured file. Go to /missions/basic/8/TheFile.php to
get your password.
