To get your computer ready for programming using an [ISP
Programmer](ISP Programmer "wikilink") and development first you need
the compiler and programmer:

    sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude

Then you need to make sure you have the parallel port device file ready:

    ls -l /dev/parport0

If not you need to make do some mod probing or bios checking?

I use this [AVR Makefile](AVR Makefile "wikilink") that is in the public
domain to program.
