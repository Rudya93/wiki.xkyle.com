The Seagate Dockstar is a cool little ARM based Plug computer.

### Serial Port

To do any real hacking on the Dockstar, you have to connect the serial
console to your computer. I recommend using [sparkfun's 3.3v FTDI
board](https://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8772)
to make it easy. Then connect up the matching pins according to the
diagram:\
