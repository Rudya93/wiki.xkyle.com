SELVIEW is an [[Intel]] utility to read [[IPMI]] system event logs. It is not as easy to use as other IPMI utilities, but it often can decode every piece of information regarding the output codes.

=== Install ===
# Locate the support page for your Intel motherboard
# Find and download the selview utility. Example: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/server/sb/CS-031911.htm

=== Usage ===
 # install java!
 cd /usr/local/selview
 ./selview /save kyle.sel
 # Your output has to have .sel for some reason

=== Make an RPM ===
Use [[fpm]] to turn random directories into [[rpm]]s or [[deb]]s.
 cd Your-Unpacked-SELVIEW
 fpm -n selview -v 11.0B5 -t rpm -C /usr/local/ -s dir ./selview/
