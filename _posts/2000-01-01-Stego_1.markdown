The original string of 0's and 1's from the image between "00 00":

    0011100001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110

This bit stream is only 55 bits! Its missing a 1 or 0 somewhere in
there. I used this script to generate all possibilities of valid
bitstreams:

    #!/bin/bash
    for EACH in `seq 1 51`
    do
    let NEXT=$EACH+1
    #Stick in a 0
    cat original | cut -c 1-$EACH | tr -d [:cntrl:]
    echo -n 0
    cat original | cut -c $NEXT-100 | tr -d [:cntrl:]
    echo  00001101

    #stick in a 1
    cat original | cut -c 1-$EACH | tr -d [:cntrl:]
    echo -n 1
    cat original | cut -c $NEXT-100 | tr -d [:cntrl:]
    echo 00001101 #Stick on a carrige return at the end
    done

With all of these bit streams I use

    00111000001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110

Is the correct binary stream, which is **837has6**
