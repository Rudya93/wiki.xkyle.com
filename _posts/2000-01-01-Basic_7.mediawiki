This mission requires basic knowledge of linux shell commands and operators. The command "ls" lists the contents of a directory, while the semicolon (";") character ends one command without requiring a newline / RET.
<br>You need to end the "cal" command and run ls. The script being run is similar in effect to
<pre>echo exec("cal ... ".$_POST['cal']);</pre>
With a normal input (a 4 digit number) the code is effectively
<pre>echo exec("cal ... 1999");</pre>
We want to end the "cal" command and start the "ls" command, so we use a semicolon, making the input "1999; ls" and the code
<pre>echo exec("cal ... 1999; ls");</pre>
This should output the normal calendar information, and at the bottom there should be something like
<pre>.
..
level7.php
cal.pl

index.php
k1kh31b1n55h.php
perl5.8.9.core</pre>
