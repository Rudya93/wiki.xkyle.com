[[dd]] is a great tool do disk dump from one disk to another. But sometimes you need to do this over a network:

* '''Destination''' server:
 nc -l -p 7000 | gzip -dfc | dd bs=1M of=/dev/sda

* And on the '''source''' system:
 DST=4.2.2.2
 dd bs=1M if=/dev/sda | gzip  -cf | nc $DST 7000 -q 10

Performance wise, writing to a mounted filesystem seems to give much better performance, even with the large block size.
