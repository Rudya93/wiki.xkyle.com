Puppet autosigning makes it so you don't have to run "puppet cert sign" whenever you have a new client connecting.

But it can be dangerous depending on who you let connect to your puppet master server.

Put this in /etc/puppet/autosign.conf
 hostname.domain.com
 *.secure.domain.com

You can add arbitrary hosts and wildcards in this file. They are ready immediately when a client connects (no need to restart puppetmaster).
