This mission is very hard to do without help. Refresh the main mission
page a few times. Notice that the song changes. All of the songs are by
the same person - Elton John.\
Music is organized in many different ways, some of them better than
others. This happens to be letter-by-letter in directories. Go to
/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/\
This is a dead end, just like all of the other directories in there, but
this one has a hidden file. Go to
/missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/.htaccess\
You can read up on how .htaccess files work if you like, but this one
basically says to allow people to access the .htaccess, but don't show
the files ".htaccess" or "DaAnswer\*" in the index (which is why it
looks like a dead end).\
Going to /missions/basic/11/e/l/t/o/n/DaAnswer . You'll see "The answer
is \*! Just look a little harder.". The answer is, literally, whatever
the \* replaces for you. Go to /missions/basic/11/index.php and enter
whatever it said for you.\
\
The "Go On" link at the end goes to /missions/basic/12/, which isn't
created yet.
