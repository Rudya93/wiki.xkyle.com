The original string of 0's and 1's from the image between "00 00":
<pre>
0011100001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110
</pre>

This bit stream is only 55 bits! Its missing a 1 or 0 somewhere in there. I used this script to generate all possibilities of valid bitstreams:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
for EACH in `seq 1 51`
do
let NEXT=$EACH+1
#Stick in a 0
cat original | cut -c 1-$EACH | tr -d [:cntrl:]
echo -n 0
cat original | cut -c $NEXT-100 | tr -d [:cntrl:]
echo  00001101

#stick in a 1
cat original | cut -c 1-$EACH | tr -d [:cntrl:]
echo -n 1
cat original | cut -c $NEXT-100 | tr -d [:cntrl:]
echo 00001101 #Stick on a carrige return at the end
done
</pre>

With all of these bit streams I use http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp

<pre>00111000001100110011011101101000011000010111001100110110</pre>
Is the correct binary stream, which is '''837has6'''
