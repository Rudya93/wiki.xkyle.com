To get your computer ready for programming using an [[ISP Programmer]] and development first you need the compiler and programmer:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude
</pre>

Then you need to make sure you have the parallel port device file ready:
<pre>
ls -l /dev/parport0
</pre>

If not you need to make do some mod probing or bios checking?

I use this [[AVR Makefile]] that is in the public domain to program.
