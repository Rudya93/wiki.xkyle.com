If you have an arduino or a [[AVR]] microcontroller that needs programming, but you don't have a bootloader installed, you can use the ISP method of programming.

First, build a cable:

Its just cables and 3 resistors. Cheap!

Then run the software: (on linux)
<pre>
rmmod lp
modprobe ppdev
</pre>

This should have created a /dev/parport0 file in the /dev directory.

if you run:
<pre>
 uisp -dprog=dapa
</pre>
it should tell you what kind of chip you have.


Now Program:
<pre>
avrdude -p attiny13 -P /dev/parport0 -c dapa                -U flash:w:Flame_Board_Code.hex

avrdude -p chiptype -P (device file) -c (programmer type)   -U whattoprogram:write:filename
</pre>
