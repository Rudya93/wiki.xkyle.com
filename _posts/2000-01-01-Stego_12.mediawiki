This given bitmap has a single row of grey values, with the hint 'I am the not of a file'. This sounds like the values are the "not" as in, inverse of a file. This python script I wrote will spit out the values of the bitmap:
<pre>
#!/usr//bin/python
import Image
import sys
im = Image.open("12.bmp")
newnumber = 0
oldnumber = 0
counter = 0
width = range(0,123)
hight = range(0,1)
for each2 in hight:
        for each1 in width:
                it = im.getpixel((each1,each2))
                print chr(255-it),
                sys.stdout.softspace = 0
print 
</pre>

If you run this you get:
<pre>
PK���t��8ZJ�G		pass.txt6ae4nt5TBPK����t��8ZJ�G		� pass.txtPK���6/
</pre>

There is something in there... is that a zip file?

<pre>
$ python decode.py > file
$ file file
file: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
$ unzip file
Archive:  file
 extracting: pass.txt  
$ cat pass.txt 
6ae4nt5TB
</pre>
