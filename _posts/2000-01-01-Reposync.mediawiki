Reposync allows you to download rpms to make your own local mirrors. Kinda like [[apt-mirror]].

=== Get it ===
 yum install yum-utils
Or if you are on Ubuntu? Yes you can do this on Ubuntu.
 apt-get install yum-utils

=== Use It ===
Define a repo in yum.conf or in yum.repos.d. It doesn't have to match your current distro or arch:
 [f17-arm-release]
 name=Fedora $releasever - $basearch - Release
 failovermethod=priority
 baseurl=http://archive.eu.kernel.org/fedora-secondary/releases/17/Everything/arm/os/
 enabled=0
 gpgcheck=0

Now fetch stuff:
 reposync -r f17-arm-release -p /storage/mirrors/f17-arm/ -a armv5tel

Specifying the arch is necessary if you are downloading rpms from an alien architecture.
