In this mission you are given a kindergarten-encrypted password, and you
need to reverse-engineer the encryption.\
You'll notice that if you encrypt "aaaaa" it gives you "abcde". This
encryption simply adds the character number to the character, starting
at 0.\
You can use <http://www.asciitable.com/> to find the progression of
symbols. Ex. if your encrypted password is "968d\<56\>" you need to
subtract 1 from the second letter, 2 from the third, and three from the
fourth, producing "956a". It isn't obvious what \< goes to, so use the
link to find out that it is "8". Continuing, you end up with "956a8007",
which correctly "encrypts" to "968d\<56\>".
