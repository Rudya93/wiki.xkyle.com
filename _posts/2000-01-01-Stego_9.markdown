This challenge has a stereo audio file with the left and right out of
phase. Mixing them together produces the difference, which contains
morse code.

    $ sox ecstasy-atb-music.wav  -c 1 out.wav

If you can decode morse by ear you go it! Otherwise use rscw or do it by
hand:

    sox out.wav  -t ub - | rscw  -f 720-750 -w 11

This will give you a string of numbers that represent ascii characters.
Use a decimal to ascii converter
